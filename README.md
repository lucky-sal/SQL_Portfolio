#Salvatore Barnao's SQL Portfolio
Hello, and thanks for stopping by! This repository contains examples of SQL I've written for solo projects and while working through SQL, machine learning, and other data analytics courses. Below are a few highlighted projects, including data visualizations I created using Tableau. Feel free to take a look around and [reach out]([url](https://www.linkedin.com/in/salvatore-barnao-b4421562/)) if you have any feedback or questions.
